![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-2.0-blue.svg)

## Version History
**Current Version:** 2.0 (Late July 2025)
- Major update: Expanded glossary, added "Key Takeaways" for each district, improved formatting and navigation, updated for 2024 results, and enhanced accessibility for public release.

See the main case study for a detailed changelog.

**Previous Version:** 1.0 (Early July 2025)
- Initial public release: Included district-level and statewide results for all major races (2008–2024), background/context, methodology, project structure, and data sources. Focused on clarity, consistent formatting, and comprehensive tables, but did not include Key Takeaways, an expanded glossary, or versioning features. Some data inconsistencies were present in this version.


## Background & Context
North Carolina has become a bellwether for national political trends, reflecting the evolving dynamics of the American South. Over the past two decades, the state has experienced rapid population growth, significant urbanization, and increasing racial and generational diversity. These changes have contributed to North Carolina’s status as a perennial swing state, with both major parties investing heavily in campaigns and voter outreach.

The state’s congressional districts have been redrawn repeatedly due to court-ordered redistricting and ongoing debates over partisan gerrymandering. This has made it difficult to track long-term partisan trends at the district level. By retrofitting all major statewide election results (2008–2024) onto the 2023–2025 14-district map, this case study enables direct, year-over-year comparisons and reveals how political realignment has played out across different regions.

This project includes results for President, U.S. Senate, Governor, Lt. Governor, Attorney General, and recent North Carolina Supreme Court races. It highlights:
- The persistence and decline of split-ticket voting
- The growing urban-rural and suburban divide
- The impact of demographic change and migration
- The effects of redistricting and legal battles on representation

By providing district-level and statewide data in a consistent format, the study offers valuable insights for political scientists, journalists, students, and anyone interested in the forces shaping North Carolina’s—and the nation’s—political future.

**Note:** North Carolina had 13 districts prior to the 2020 census. All historical results are retrofitted to the 2023–2025 14-district map for consistency and comparative analysis. As of the 2025 Congress, the map has been redrawn again due to ongoing litigation and partisan gerrymandering, so the current map may differ from the one used in this analysis. This case study uses the 2023–2025 map as a stable reference point for historical comparison, but readers should be aware that district boundaries and numbers may change in future cycles.

This project analyzes partisan realignment and electoral trends in North Carolina's congressional districts using historical election data (2008–2024) projected onto the 2023–2025 14-district map. It covers all major statewide races—President, U.S. Senate, Governor, Lt. Governor, Attorney General, and recent North Carolina Supreme Court contests.

## Project Structure
- **NC_Case_Study.md**: Main case study with detailed analysis, tables, and commentary.
- **Data files**: CSVs for each election year (e.g., `2008 Pres Statistics.csv`, `2012 Pres Statistics.csv`, etc.)

## Methodology
- All results are retrofitted to the 2023–2025 14-district map for consistency, even for years with only 13 districts.
- District-level and statewide results are included for each race.
- Data is cross-checked for accuracy and formatted for direct comparison across cycles.

## Data Sources
- Official North Carolina election results (2008–2024)
- 2022+ congressional map reference


## Quick Start
- Open `NC_Case_Study.md` to explore the full analysis, tables, historical context, "Key Takeaways" by district, and a comprehensive glossary.
- Use the CSV data files for each election year to view raw district-level results.

## Key Findings (Sample)
- North Carolina’s urban and suburban districts have trended more Democratic, while rural areas have shifted more Republican since 2008.
- Split-ticket voting has declined but persists in some Council of State and judicial races.
- Redistricting and legal battles have repeatedly altered the political landscape, making consistent analysis challenging without a stable map.
- "Key Takeaways" sections summarize the most important trends and realignment patterns for each district.
- County flips and margin analysis highlight the evolving partisan landscape and the impact of demographic and legal changes.

## Glossary of Key Terms
- **Oth**: Other (third-party or independent candidates)
- **Margin**: Difference in percentage points between the top two candidates
- **Flip**: When a district or county changes party from the previous election
- **Split-ticket voting**: When voters select candidates from different parties for different offices in the same election.
- **Council of State**: The group of statewide elected executive offices in North Carolina, including Governor, Lt. Governor, Attorney General, and others.
- **Redistricting**: The process of redrawing electoral district boundaries, often after a census, which can affect political representation and election outcomes.
- **Key Takeaways**: Bullet-point summaries in the main case study highlighting the most important trends and insights for each district.
- **County flip**: When a county changes party allegiance compared to the previous election for a given office.
- **Retrofitting**: Applying historical election results to a new or current district map for consistent comparison across years.
